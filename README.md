## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned that the more I work on HTML and CSS (CSS specifically), the more things come to me like second nature. There were a few things that just clicked as I went along but some things I had to lookup using MDN or stackoverflow etc.

### Continued development

The main takeaway that I had form this challenge is to trust in myself and the knowledge that I've gained so far. I always plan on gaining a better understanding of media query. I used it once on this challenge but I know I could have down more with it to get a more responsive page.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - A pretty simple resource that I'm sure everyone uses, however it is really helpful. I use it every chance I get.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to shoutout Kevin Powell for the amazing videos his creates on YouTube. I've learned a lot from him as far as CSS goes. There's still much for me to learn, but because of him I have a better understanding of how things work. As a beginner I knew nothing about CSS reset codes or custom properties until I watched his videos. Anyway, I'm rambling. Check out his YouTube channel if you haven't already.
